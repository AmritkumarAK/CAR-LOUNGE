<h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>
1. THE BUGATTI LA VOITURE NOIRE   $19 million</i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2020</h5>
    <img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106071611-1565364525567villaeste19-d2-0013.jpg?v=1565364749&w=740&h=416" class="responsive">



    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>THE BUGATTI LA VOITURE NOIRE</u></i></span>According to Bugatti, their vintage Type 57 SC Atlantic reflects the marque's "pioneering spirit, passion for perfection and the desire to continually redefine its limits". As such, Bugatti drew inspiration from the old Type 57 when creating La Voiture Noire - or "the Black Car" (we reckon it sounds better in French). One of the four Atlantics ever built has been missing since World War Two - and La Voiture Noire is a homage to that car.

At $18.68 million (£15m), La Voiture Noire has the biggest price tag of any car, ever. Only one will ever exist, and more than two years after it was sold, it still hasn’t left the production line!

La Voiture Noire packs a 1,500 horsepower engine that pushes it to speeds of up to 261mph.

“We produced a true one-off, a single unit car that we call automotive haute couture,” said Achim Anscheidt, Bugatti’s design director. “It’s not just a car anymore, it’s really more like a piece of art in line with the highly exclusive fashion and luxury brands in France.”</h3>

<h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>2. THE ROLLS-ROYCE SWEPTAIL   $13 million</i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2017</h5>
    <img src="https://moneyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Rolls-Royce-Sweptail-1-750x499.jpg" class="responsive">



    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>THE ROLLS-ROYCE SWEPTAIL</u></i></span>is another one-off car, and one that also draws inspiration from the finer things in life. Giles Taylor, director of design at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, described the Sweptail as "the automotive equivalent of Haute couture".

The Sweptail was also inspired by the coach building of the 1920s and 1930s, and was commissioned at the request of an aircraft and superyacht specialist who had a special idea.

Costing $12.8 million in 2017, at the time it was finished it was the most expensive car of all time. Just two years later it was supplanted by Bugatti's La Voiture Noire, listed above.</h3>

<h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>3. THE BUGATTI CENTODIECI  $8.9 million </i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2021</h5>
    <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/13-cd-campogalliano-web-1565972199.jpg?crop=0.753xw:1.00xh;0.178xw,0&resize=768:*" class="responsive">



    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>THE BUGATTI CENTODIECI</u></i></span>.The Centodieci continues Bugatti’s successful 110-year course of exceptional design and performance, while reviving the memory of the brand’s recent history. With the Centodieci – Italian for 110 – Bugatti created a reinterpretation of the epochal EB110, which, when presented in 1991, was considered the fastest and most extraordinary supercar of its time. The EB110, built by Romano Artioli in Italy, was an important intermediate step for the refoundation of Bugatti in 1998 and for the return to the French roots in Molsheim.

Inspired by the historical model, the Centodieci pushes all boundaries of imagination with its breathtaking performance and pioneering design. Featuring a modern interpretation of the classic wedge shape and with the iconic W16 engine, the Centodieci transports the EB110 gracefully into a new millennium. The ten limited-edition vehicles are distinguished by their perfect elegance and sculptural beauty, making the Centodieci a true, tangible work of art.<</h3>

<h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>4. MARCEDES-BENZ MAYBACH EXELERO  $8 million </i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2004</h5>
    <img src="https://www.startrescue.co.uk/media/86941463-0150-44a7-816e-aee46644dcdd.jpg" class="responsive">



    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>MARCEDES-BENZ MAYBACH EXELERO</u></i></span>This one-off Batman-esque sports car was built by Italian car firm Stola, in collaboration with  DaimlerChrysler. It was made to show off the Carat Exelero tyre range from Goodyear, whose subsidiary Fulda commissioned it. And while all these big names sound impressively complicated, the final design was completed by four students from Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences. The only stipulation was that the car must reach 217 mph in order to test out the tyres fully.</h3>

<h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>5. KOENIGSEGG CCXR TREVITA $4.8 million </i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2006</h5>
    <img src="https://mcdn.wallpapersafari.com/medium/57/79/dTvSof.jpg" class="responsive">

    <h3 class="parastyle1"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>KOENIGSEGG CCXR TREVITA</u></i></span>.When the sunlight hits the carbon fibre of the Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita, it sparkles as if millions of diamonds are in the body; Trevita means "three whites" in Swedish.

Purportedly a Trevita was bought by Floyd Mayweather for $4.8m. It's V8 engine boasts 1,018hp and it can reach at least 254 mph

 </h3>
<h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>6. LAMBORGHINI VENEO $4.5 million </i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2013</h5>
    <img src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/Oyn7B/s1/lamborghini-veneno-leaked-46-million-and-fast.jpg" class="responsive">

    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>LAMBORGHINI VENEOA</u></i></span>.Based on the Lamborghini Aventador, the Veneno was built to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Lamborghini. It features the Aventador's 6.5-litre V12, producing 740 hp and is a road-going version of Lambo’s racing prototype. It can go 0 to 60mph in just 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 221 mph.

The name "Veneno" comes from a famous fighting bull; most Lamborghinis are named after deceased bovine warriors, and all of them, including Veneno, had sent a matador to the next life.

</h3>

 <h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>7. LAMBORGHINI SIAN $3.6 million </i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2019</h5>
    <img src="https://cdn.carbuzz.com/gallery-images/2020-lamborghini-sian-carbuzz-623804.jpg" class="responsive">

    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>LAMBORGHINI SIAN</u></i></span>A little less "crazy bull" than the Veneno, the Sian isn’t even named after a killer bull. Sian in fact comes from the Bolognese word for 'flash' or 'lighting', a name that was first used on a Lambo in 1963. As such, just 63 of them will be built, and they've all been bagged. A 2020 soft-top version has also been made - and all 19 of those have been sold too!

</h3>

<h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>8. W MOTORS LYKAN HYPERSPORT $3.4 million </i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2013</h5>
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/2u2ge22dqu621.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=53eb3398c80db7d69b51cfaedcc3688cfde17617" class="responsive">
    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>W MOTORS LYKAN HYPERSPORT</u></i></span>.The Lykan Hypersport is the Middle East's one and only supercar - with a 3.7-litre 750bhp engine and the ability to move from 0-60mph in 2.8 seconds. It's top speed is 242mph - the least you would expect for $3.4 million.But when the 22mph LaFerrari is a "snip" at just $1,416,362, why would you splash out for the Hypersport? The answer, say the makers, is "luxury": think gold seat stitching and diamonds in the headlights.

 <h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>9. LIMITED-EDITION BUGATTI VEYRON BY MANSORY VIVERE $3.4 million </i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2005</h5>
    <img src="https://www.thesupercarblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bugatti-Veyron-Mansory-Linea-Vivere-for-sale-7.jpg" class="responsive">

    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parastyle2"><i><u>LIMITED-EDITION BUGATTI VEYRON BY MANSORY VIVERE</u></i></span>Mansory, a luxury car modification firm based in Germany, managed to make the already-expensive Bugatti Veyron a little bit more expensive. They took a Grand Sport Vitesse Roadster and among lots of other things, fitted an accumulation spoiler package, new LED lights and an upgraded cabin.

</h3>

 <h2 style="color:navy;font-size: 40px"><i>10. FERRARI PININFARINA SERGIO  $3 million </i></h2>
    <h5>Launched in the year 2013</h5>
    <img src="https://moneyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2013-Ferrari-Pininfarina-Sergio-Concept-750x422.jpg" class="responsive">

    <h3 class="parastyle"><span class="parasfile:///C:/Users/Saroo/Desktop/CAR%20LOUNGE/all.csstyle2"><i><u>FERRARI PININFARINA SERGIO</u></i></span>Sergio Pininfarina, son of founder Battista ‘Pinin’ Farina, was honoured with this very special limited edition Ferrari. Sergio was instrumental in ensuring Ferrari survived and thrived after his father’s death. The sweeping curves of the Pinafarina are so unorthodox, for a second it looks as if the front is actually the rear.
